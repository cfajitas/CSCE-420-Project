Compilation Instuctions:

Using the Makefile:
'make all' will compile the entire program
'./Main' will run the program
'make clean' will delete any .o files and executables generated

The c++ compilation version can easily be changed if there are 
any compatibility issues with c++14 by changing the flag at the top 
of the Makefile. This program has been tested for compatibility with both 
c++11 and c++14.
