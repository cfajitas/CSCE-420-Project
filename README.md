# CSCE_420_Project
This project uses a genetic algorithm and a A* algorithm in order to construct a series of Toffoli gates that manipulate the bits of prime numbers in order to get their product. Since the resulting solver was made with Toffoli gates, it can be reversed in order to factor prime numbers.
